Use [Paper Elements](https://www.webcomponents.org/collection/PolymerElements/paper-elements) in your ambitious Ember Application! This addon exposes Paper Elements as Ember Components, so you can use paper elements like you use any other components. Uses [ember-polymer](https://github.com/dunnkers/ember-polymer) to pull in Polymer.

## Installation

```shell
ember install ember-polymer-paper
```

## Usage

First, install a paper element:

```shell
bower install PolymerElements/paper-input --save
```

Now we can use this like an ember component! Example:

```
{{paper-input update=(action (mut name)) label="Your name"}}
```

That's it, the element should work with a two-way binding!

## Requirements

This addon forces Polymer to use Shadow DOM. Browsers that do not natively support Shadow DOM will be supplied with the [polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs). Note that this polyfill might result in slightly slower rendering.
